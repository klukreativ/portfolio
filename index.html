                        <p>
                            Hi, I'm a Frontend Web Developer with skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and React.js. I'm
                            currently enrolled in Juno College of Technology where I've had the chance to develop these
                            skills both in class and through self study to create both personal and group projects. As a
                            tech enthusiast and a lover of all things Microsoft, my recent foray into the tech field has
                            been an exciting journey and one I continually to grow more passionate about.
                            <br /><br />
                            I've had over 10 years of experience in communication based fields, both in education and
                            sales, as well as in various capacities including management. From teaching elementary and
                            middle-school students to assessing the needs of my clients, I've learned the importance of
                            adapting my approach to custom tailor a situation for whomever I'm working with. I've found
                            great satisfaction from finding the perfect solution for my clients, as well as helping my
                            students succeed both in their personal goals as well as various competitions I've coached
                            them.
                            <br /><br />
                            I'm looking to leverage these skills in my tech based career, and looking forward to working
                            in a team based environment where I can continue to practice my craft and increase my
                            knowledge in related fields. Collaboration is an important skill I acquired when working in
                            a team management setting, where I've had the chance to apply my own strengths as well as
                            continue my own personal development under the tutelage of others.<br /><br />
                            When I'm not practicing or learning code, you can likely find me hunched over my desk to
                            engage in my lifelong love of painting miniatures, tossing dice in a board game or session
                            of AD&D, adding too many chilis to my latest dish, exploring new trails with my dogs, or
                            searching for hidden treasures at my local thrift shop.
